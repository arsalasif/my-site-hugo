Recent graduate from M.Sc. Computer Science (Thesis) program at University of Manitoba. Open to opportunities.

I am a versatile individual, who has worked as a Graphic Designer, Software Engineer, and Researcher.

At my core, I am a Software Engineer and a Researcher in Computer Science. I believe you need to be able to research to develop good software, and you need to be able to code to actualize your research ideas.

As a software engineer, my core focus is on designing maintainable, efficient software. I am proficient in Data Structures and Algorithms. In my professional experience, I designed and developed a multi-tenant software for a SaaS model, employing best practices and architecture.

As a researcher, my interests are Computer Vision and Deep Learning. My recent work is a Visual Saliency model for videos, where my model successfully achieved results that outperformed the previous state-of-the-art models. Based on my research, I have also authored a paper for the top-tier conference European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2020.

If you need someone who can code as well as research, specifically related to Machine Learning/Computer Vision/Deep Learning, then you are at the right website.
