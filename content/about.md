I am a software engineer who loves wearing many hats. I love software engineering, machine learning and computer vision. After working as a professional software engineer, I completed my Master's degree focused on research in Computer Vision. With a language-agnostic mindset, I am always learning new things, in different domains.

If you need someone who can code as well as research, then feel free to give me a nudge.
