It's been almost a year since I last posted here. Life got really busy, and I haven't updated anything on the website.

### What I have been upto
After a bunch of freelancing gigs, I moved onto a full-time role as a Senior Software Engineer. Met and worked with a bunch of amazing people, and got back to Canada as well.

I'm currently living in this quiet, beautiful city of Kitchener and working remotely. Here's a picture from one of the recent sightseeing trips:

I'll try to regularly update this website. Until next time!
