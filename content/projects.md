### REST API
**• Jogging Times API**\
`Python, Flask, Docker, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Celery, AMQP, Gunicorn, JWT, SwaggerUI`\
A RESTful API for users to track their jogging times. Containerized Docker build with separate docker services for database, message-broker, API, and documentation. Separate environments and configs for development, testing, and production. Authentication via JWT. Documentation via Swagger.
<ins>Code available soon.</ins>

**• Techlogix Enterprise Mobility**\
`C#, .NET, C# Reflection, DotLiquid, SQL Server, LINQ, Entity Framework, Microsoft Azure, OAuth, BitBucket, JIRA`\
As a Software Engineer at Techlogix, I worked on the TMX Enterprise Mobility software. \

### Computer Vision

**• Predicting Visual Saliency in Videos**\
`Python, C++, PyTorch, Keras, OpenCV-Python, PyTorch CUDA, Virtualenv, MATLAB, Bash, Graphviz, LaTeX`\
Research project for my Master's Thesis. Created a video saliency model using Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture that quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms the state-of-the-art. Paper currently submitted to [European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2020](https://eccv2020.eu/) for publication.\

**• Depth Estimation**\
`Python, LaTeX`\
Reported the best and recent Deep Learning approaches for Depth Estimation. Identified the state-of-the-art research in the field, and provided a roadmap building to the best available method.

### Graph Theory

**• Graph Edge Coloring**\
`Java, GraphStream`\
Implemented an edge-coloring graph theory algorithm. The algorithm was based on Vizing's Theorem that states that graphs can be colored in Δ or Δ + 1 colors.\

### Online Algorithms

**• Experimental Analysis of Sequential Search Heuristics**\
`Java, Python`\
Evaluated classic sequential search heuristics Move-to-Front (MTF), Transpose and K-in-a-Row on Trees and Lists. Markov chain model and Zipfian distribution were used for different types of access sequences generation.\

### Parallel Programming

**• Hybrid OpenMP-MPI Approach for Breadth First Search**\
`C, Bash, OpenMP, MPI`\
Implemented a hybrid OpenMP-MPI algorithm for BFS. Benchmarks were evaluated against optimized implementations of classic sequential search algorithms.\

### Comparative Genomics

**• Whole Genome Duplication Analysis and Phylogenetic Tree Construction**\
`Python, CoGe, SynMap`\
Designed a workflow for identifying whole genome duplication events in evolutionary lineages. Syntenic blocks of genomes were compared and a similarity distribution was generated from the comparisons. The results were used for constructing a tree topology describing a phylogeny.\
